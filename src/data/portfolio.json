Whether they are on vacation, moving from parent's home or just wanting to know how living with another person is, this will help them not only in the logistics of accommodation and money, but give them a safe place and environment to stay. It was born because I wanted to make something unique and useful for a target audience that is constantly in danger. Women are a delicate population in terms of safety and freedom, they need a really safe space for this kind of needs.This idea had a concise but complex process since I embraced all the stages of Design Thinking methodology (Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype and Test). I developed all of these stages cautiously and at a great level of detail, with the result being really successful.",
